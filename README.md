# Rabbeinu-Tam-Android-App
This is a passion project that I created while in college.
The goal was to create an android app that would be able to calculate what time is sof zman rabbeinu tam.
In order to create this app, I needed an API that would give me sunrise and sunset times. I was recommended the KosherJava API, and that is the basis for this app's zmanim.

Included in the app, is the ability to add elevation data to the sunrise and sunset times. In order to find out the relevant elevation data, I found a website called chaitables.com
that gathered this information for each city. In the app, you can choose to navigate the website and find your city's elevation data.
